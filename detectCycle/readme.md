*Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.*

 

## Example 1:
    Input:  head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
    Output: true

## Example 2:
    Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
    Output: true

## Example 3:
    Input: head = [1], pos = -1
    Output: false
 

## Constraints:
      The number of the nodes in the list is in the range [0, 104].
      -105 <= Node.val <= 105
      pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked-list.
